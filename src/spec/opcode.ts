	 * `drem` instruction - Remainder double.
	 *
	 * Both value1 and value2 must be of type double. The values
	 * are popped from the operand stack. The double result is calculated and pushed onto the
	 * operand stack.
	 * The result of a drem instruction is not the same as the result of
	 * the remainder operation defined by IEEE 754, due to the choice of
	 * rounding policy in the Java Virtual Machine (§2.8).
	 * The IEEE 754 remainder operation computes the remainder from a rounding
	 * division, not a truncating division, and so its behavior
	 * is not analogous to that of the usual integer
	 * remainder operator. Instead, the Java Virtual Machine defines drem to behave in
	 * a manner analogous to that of the integer remainder
	 * instructions irem and lrem, with an implied division using the
	 * round toward zero rounding policy; this may be compared with the C
	 * library function fmod.
	 * The result of a drem instruction is governed by the following
	 * rules, which match IEEE 754 arithmetic except for how the
	 * implied division is computed:
	 * If either value1 or value2 is NaN, the result is NaN.
	 * If neither value1 nor value2 is NaN, the sign of the
	 * result equals the sign of the dividend.
	 * If the dividend is an infinity or the divisor is a zero or
	 * both, the result is NaN.
	 * If the dividend is finite and the divisor is an infinity, the
	 * result equals the dividend.
	 * If the dividend is a zero and the divisor is finite, the
	 * result equals the dividend.
	 * In the remaining cases, where neither operand is an infinity,
	 * a zero, or NaN, the floating-point remainder result from a
	 * dividend value1 and a divisor value2 is defined by the
	 * mathematical relation result = value1 - (value2 *
	 * q), where q is an integer that is negative only if
	 * value1 / value2 is negative, and positive only if
	 * value1 / value2 is positive, and whose magnitude is as
	 * large as possible without exceeding the magnitude of the true
	 * mathematical quotient of value1 and value2.
	 * If either value1 or value2 is NaN, the result is NaN.
	 * If neither value1 nor value2 is NaN, the sign of the
	 * result equals the sign of the dividend.
	 * If the dividend is an infinity or the divisor is a zero or
	 * both, the result is NaN.
	 * If the dividend is finite and the divisor is an infinity, the
	 * result equals the dividend.
	 * If the dividend is a zero and the divisor is finite, the
	 * result equals the dividend.
	 * In the remaining cases, where neither operand is an infinity,
	 * a zero, or NaN, the floating-point remainder result from a
	 * dividend value1 and a divisor value2 is defined by the
	 * mathematical relation result = value1 - (value2 *

	 * instruction modifies one of the instructions iload, fload,

	 * In either case, the wide opcode itself is followed in the
	 * compiled code by the opcode of the instruction wide modifies. In
	 * either form, two unsigned bytes indexbyte1 and indexbyte2

	 * unsigned index to a local variable in the current frame
	 * (§2.6), where the value of the index is
	 * (indexbyte1 << 8) | indexbyte2. The calculated index
	 * must be an index into the local variable array of the current
	 * frame. Where the wide instruction modifies an lload, dload,
	 * lstore, or dstore instruction, the index following the
	 * calculated index (index + 1) must also be an index into the local
	 * variable array. In the second form, two immediate unsigned bytes
	 * constbyte1
	 * and constbyte2 follow indexbyte1 and
	 * indexbyte2 in the code stream. Those bytes are also assembled
	 * into a signed 16-bit constant, where the constant is
	 * (constbyte1 << 8)
